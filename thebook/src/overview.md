# Collaborating with git

[ ![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png) ](https://xkcd.com/1597/)

## Overview

Unlike [Cueball](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Cueball), your team will learn git well enough to collaborate effectively with it! In this two-session hands-on course, you will work as a team to build a simple static website, laying a foundation for communicating about code in a professional development environment.

You will build confidence and practical skills with git through hands-on work with **The Three Objects**[^3objs] of git's _data model_ -- moving them around **The Three Trees**[^3trees] of git's _state model_.

You will learn to use __Pull Requests__ (aka PR's) to communicate changes to your team for review and integration into the team's shared work stream.

In the course of a collaborative software development project, you will run various git commands in a **Bash shell** to examine and change the state of git objects in these trees on your local machine.  Some of these commands may be familiar (e.g., `git checkout`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, `git diff`) and some may not (`git reset`, `git diff --staged`, `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick`).

Another major theme is **workflows**.  We will learn and practice some [Common Git Workflows](common-git-workflows.md), especially those built around **Pull Requests**, as you build your site. For instance, as your team begins to deliver code, you will encounter challenges (merge conflicts!) inherent to concurrent work on a shared code base, and you will practice using git's and Github's features to resolve them.

Your team will collaborate by working concurrently on changes and delivering to `main`, aiming toward making your site look more or less like `index.html` in the [sample repo](https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-sample-project-repo).[^sample-repo-note]

Coding will be kept simple to allow you to focus on git skills; you and your team will modify static HTML and CSS files.  The only "webserver" is your local filesystem.

Keep your website viable as you deliver each change to `main`. &nbsp;&nbsp;Don't "break the build"!

By the end of our time, we'll have substantially covered the topics in the [Course Syllabus](syllabus.md).

### About the instructor
As a devops professional with three-ish decades of experience in version control, I first experienced git in 2009 when our developers insisted on bringing it into the company.  I learned a few basic survival commands, but it wasn't really clicking for me. Depressingly often for a version control "expert", I got out of my depth and had to be rescued.

Eventually I tired of memorizing magic spells and decided to buckle down and learn the basics of git.  Suddenly, git started making senseðŸ˜®!  That feeling of enlightenment, along with the big boost in my productivity, helped inspire this course.

I've presented some variation of this material to nearly every [CodePlatoon](https://codeplatoon.org) cohort since Bravo.  Equipped with a firm grasp of these git fundamentals, graduates have reported they've become go-to resources for git in their software teams.

[^3objs]: The **three objects** are `commit`, `tree`, and `blob`

[^3trees]: The **three trees** are `working tree`, `index`, and `HEAD`

[^sample-repo-note]:  You can't view the rendered `index.html` directly from Github, which only shows the HTML source.  View it by cloning the [sample repo](https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-sample-project-repo) and opening `index.html` in your browser (via "File --> Open File...").
