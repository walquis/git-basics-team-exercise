# Add Features As a Team
Run your project!  Collaborate with git to deliver features.

_(Optional) If your team wants to use Github project boards... **Team Lead**: create one in your GitHub org, and invite your teammates._

**Context**: At this point, your team should all be set up with clones of your team lead's starter repo, as described in Session 1's [Setup Starter Repo](/session1/setup-starter-repo.html).  You will collaborate using the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models">shared-repo model</a>, where your entire team works with clones of your team lead's repo.[^team-lead-fork]

## LAB - Implement and deliver features in the starter repo
> **Each teammate**: Choose a change to make from the below list of changes (if you're using a project board, you would create a card for it, with your name on it).
>
> Deliver changes using Pull Requests (If using a project board, update it as you go).

[^team-lead-fork] Somewhat confusingly...Even though using shared-repo and not fork-pull model, your team lead _does_ fork once, from the git-basics-starter-repo--but only to establish a repo for the team to collaborate on. No changes are flowing back to the original walquis/git-basics-starter-repo.
