# Session One

Has everyone done the [Prework](prework.md)?

Git - A fast, scalable, distributed version control system that tracks changes via a persistent map of keys hashed from stored content.

Git is like an onion - it has layers! [^how-git-works]
- Peel off "distributed" - The push/pull part
- Peel off "version control" - The branch, merge, rebase, cherry-pick parts
- Peel off "tracks changes" - The version history, author, comments & other metadata parts
- Peel off "persistent" - the "stored content" part

Now you just have "map of keys". Keys are hashes of content; each key functions as a unique address--or **map**--to the corresponding content .
