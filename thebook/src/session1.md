# Session One

Has everyone done the [Prework](prework.md)?

Git - A fast, scalable, distributed version control system that tracks changes via a persistent map of keys hashed from stored content.


![](../images/shrek-smile-small.png)
Git is like an onion - it has layers!
- Peel off "distributed" - The push/pull part
- Peel off "version control" - The branch/merge, rebase parts
- Peel off "content tracker" - The version history, comments & other metadata parts
- Now you have "persistent map" - keys are hashes of values (the map), and stored in .git (the persistence).
