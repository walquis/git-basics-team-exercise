## Install the GitGraph plugin in your VSCode

Visit the [GitGraph Plugin Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) page and follow the install instructions.

(NOTE: If you're using PyCharm, you can skip this step; git integration is built-in. Or if you like, PyCharm also has plugins like Git Machete for enhancing git integration.)

## Explore the sample website's code and repo history
This repo records the work of a five-member team: Ned, Nykhia, Dex, Deja, and Xavier.

Open `index.html` to view the website in the [git-basics-sample-project-repo](https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-sample-project-repo) that you cloned:  On a Macbook Terminal.app prompt, just `open index.html`.  Otherwise, you can open your browser, choose "File --> Open File...", navigate to `index.html` and open it.

You should see something like this...

(You could also install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VSCode, and use that to view HTML files).

Point VSCode at the `git-basics-sample-project-repo` directory, and look at the history with GitGraph:
