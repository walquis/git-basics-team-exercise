# Merging - with conflict

Let's practice another merge, but now with a change that conflicts.

But first, read up a little on [what causes merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts).

Create and checkout a new `alsoMyBranch`, but **start it from the same point where `main` started**, by providing a sha as an additional argument.  You can use several methods to refer to that point. Assuming your graph has this topology...
```
*   686e8db (HEAD -> main) merge HTML source menu updates in index.html and help.html
|\
| * ccaf82c (mybranch) each menu item on a separate line in the code
* | f7295ef each menu item on a separate line in the code (for help.html)
|/
* 2dd739a (origin/main) Some handy git aliases, and an initial .gitignore
* 4ca41a7 Initial commit
```
...the following notations all resolve to the same commit:
- `main^^` - two commits before main
- `HEAD^^` - two commits before HEAD
- `origin/main` - the commit on which the `origin/main` tracking branch sits
- `2dd739a` - the shortname of the commit
- `2dd7` - an even shorter name--works as long as it's unambiguous in the repo
- `2dd739a539c6cc30e9b3cdfa952439ba93c0c392` - the full SHA

```
git checkout -b alsoMyBranch main^^  # Each caret (^) goes back one commit
```
Now `alsoMyBranch` exists and sits on `2dd739a`, and `HEAD` is pointing to it; that is, it's your **current branch**.

Change the menu item source code in `index.html` like you did on `mybranch`--but not _exactly_ like you did; let's add another menu item to `index.html`.

From this...
```
    <a href="./index.html">Home</a> <a href="./help.html">Help</a>
```
... to this:
```
    <a href="./index.html">Home</a>
    <a href="./map.html">Map</a>
    <a href="./help.html">Help</a>
```
Save the file.  Now `git add` and `git commit`...
```
adog  # Check how the graph looks.
git diff           # What am I about to add to the index?
git add index.html
adog  # Check how the graph looks.  Has it changed?
git diff --staged  # What am I about to commit to git?
git diff           # Why does this show no differences?
git commit -m "add 'Map' to the menu"
adog  # Check how the graph looks.  How about now?
```
The git graph should now look something like this:
```
adog
* daf0eb2 (HEAD -> alsoMyBranch) add 'Map' to the menu
| *   686e8db (main) merge HTML source menu updates in index.html and help.html
| |\  
| | * ccaf82c (mybranch) each menu item on a separate line in the code
| |/  
|/|   
| * f7295ef each menu item on a separate line in the code (for help.html)
|/  
* 2dd739a (origin/main) Some handy git aliases, and an initial .gitignore
* 4ca41a7 Initial commit
```

**Let's merge!**

```
git merge mybranch   # Merge mybranch into current branch
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

There it is--the **merge conflict**.  Git doesn't have enough info to know what you want to happen.

At this point, git has placed annotations about the conflict into `index.html`, and left it up to you to figure it out.  You can view the contents of the file directly, like this:
```
cat index.html 
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Solar System</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The Solar System</h1>
    <a href="./index.html">Home</a>
<<<<<<< HEAD
    <a href="./map.html">Map</a>
=======
>>>>>>> mybranch
    <a href="./help.html">Help</a>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
The changes from your current branch show up between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`.

The changes from the merged-in `mybranch` show up between `=======` and `>>>>>>> mybranch`.

You can use VSCode to view `index.html`; VSCode understands the merge-conflict format and decorates your conflict with buttons to help out.

In this case, you would want both changes: the new `map.html` link, and the `help.html` link on a line by itself (which in this case, somewhat non-intuitively, shows up as an empty diff for the merged-in branch).

Click `Accept Both Changes` in VSCode, or manually delete the `>>>>>>>`, `<<<<<<<`, and `=======` delimiters that git added, so that the code looks like this:
```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Solar System</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The Solar System</h1>
    <a href="./index.html">Home</a>
    <a href="./map.html">Map</a>
    <a href="./help.html">Help</a>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
Now, inform git of your resolution decision by `git add`'ing the file that had the conflict:
```
git add index.html
```
And finally, commit it.  Git remembers you're still merging, so will make this commit a **merge commit**--that is, a commit with two parents.
```
git commit -m "merge 'Map' entry with mybranch"
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- You can start a branch from any commit--not necessarily the one you happen to be on.
- You can reference a commit in lots of different ways.
- By definition, merge commits have two or more parents.
- The changes for the branch you're on will show up _first_ in a merge conflict's diff report.
- The changes for the branch being merged into your current branch will show up _last_ in a merge conflict's diff report.
- NOTE: A given merge may have more than one set of conflicts to resolve, even within the same file.  **Don't assume the first conflict is the only one!**
