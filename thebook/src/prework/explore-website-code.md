# Orientation on `git-basics-starter-repo`

You'll practice your git skills by developing a simple website collaboratively.

During the prework, in [Git Environment Setup](/prework/env-setup.md), you cloned a couple of repos:

A `git-basics-sample-project-repo` of the "Solar System" website: [https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-sample-project-repo](https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-sample-project-repo).  This is a full reference implementation of the website you'll build.

A `git-basics-starter-repo` for that website:
[https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-starter-repo](https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-starter-repo).  The `git-basics-starter-repo` has the initial files and images, but little else:
- Initial versions of `index.html`, `faq.html`, `about.html`, `help.html`, and `map.html`.
- A folder with images (they are not yet referenced in the starter website's code).
- CSS files (similarly, they are also not yet used).

For instance, the starter repo's `index.html` has the beginnings of a navigation menu, but it's incomplete; your team will likely want to finish it (and add that menu to the other pages as well).

Feel free to compare the code in each repo to get a better idea of what work needs to be done.  For instance, open each repo's index.html in your browser, via "File --> Open File...".

Also, open each repo in Visual Studio Code, and browse through the code.

When your team starts to add features, you'll [organize the work into tasks](/session2/add-features.md) to build out `git-basics-starter-repo` so it looks something like `git-basics-sample-project-repo`.

NOTE: For now, just for this prework, you'll make changes locally in your clone of `git-basics-starter-repo`, and **then it's easiest and probably best to delete the entire repo**[^or-copy-elsewhere].  When the class starts, your team lead will fork `git-basics-starter-repo` into their Github account (renaming the repo to something like `solar-system`), and you will re-clone the repo from your team lead's fork.
